SS-520
===============================================================================

The **SS-520** is a two-stage Japanese [sounding rocket](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTv5H9A7wUU). Configured with an experimental 3rd stage it became the smallest rocket to ever put something in orbit on February 3<sup>rd</sup> 2018.

Basic info:

 - Overall length: **9.65 m**
 - Body diameter: **520 mm**
 - Gross Vehicle Liftoff Mass (nominal): **2.6 t**
 - Altitude (nominal): **1000 km**
 - Payload (as sounding rocket): **140 kg**

In 2016 a project was undertake to modify the vehicle into an orbital "micro-launcher". The second stage casing was redesigned to be made of reinforced carbon fiber, a guidance package was added, and a small third stage solid motor was added. The 3rd stage and satellite both fit entirely in the payload area in the nosecone.
